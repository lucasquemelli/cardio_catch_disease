# 1. Business Problem

**Description**

--- 

**Cadio Catch Disease** is a company whose business model is detecting heart disease in the early stages.The company offers an early diagnosis of cardiovascular disease for a certain price. Currently, the diagosis is has been made manually. The current accuracy is between 55% and 60%, because of the complex diagnosis and the team's fatigue. We must know:

1. Each diagnosis costs about $1000,00.
2. The price will vary according to the precision: the customer pays $500.00 for every 5% accuracy above 50%.
3. If the diagnostic precision is 50% or below, the customer doesn't pay for it.

**Purpose**

---

We must incease the diagnosis precision and make it more stable. To do it, we built a classification model to predict the cardiovascular diseases. 

**Business Questions**

--- 

1. What are the accuracy and the precision of the model? 
2. How much profit will Cardio Catch Disease have after the project? 
3. How reliable is our result?
